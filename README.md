# Inertia Crossing

**Inertia Crossing** is an interactive quiz game designed to challenge and enhance your understanding of physics concepts through randomized questions. Developed in Java using NetBeans, this application serves as a learning aid and assessment tool for Physics students.

## Project Overview

Inertia Crossing focuses on backend logic and in-memory data handling rather than advanced graphical design. It features:

- **Multiple-choice physics questions**
- **Immediate feedback after each response**
- **Final score display with answer breakdown**
- **Tracking of recent game sessions**

This project was developed as the **final requirement for our Physics 2 course**, demonstrating how computer programming can reinforce comprehension of scientific principles through simulation and interactive testing.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **NetBeans (Java SE)**: Primary development environment and GUI designer.

## Key Features

- **Circular Linked List**: Cycles through a randomized set of physics questions.
- **Queue**: Stores and manages recent scores from previous quiz sessions.
- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**: Allows efficient organization and review of past results.
- **Answer Summary**: Shows correct and incorrect answers after each quiz cycle.

## Current Limitations

- **No Database Integration**: All data is stored temporarily in memory and is lost once the application is closed.
- **No Persistent User Profiles**: Game data is only available during the current session.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a **database** for long-term score tracking and user profiles.
- Add **difficulty levels** and **topic categories** (e.g., kinematics, force, momentum).
- Add a **leaderboard** system for competitive learning.

## Expected Outcomes

This project provides a practical application of programming and logic to support Physics learning. By using familiar data structures, **Inertia Crossing** enhances student engagement and reinforces core Physics 2 concepts such as motion, forces, energy, and momentum.
